Summer Semester CA, Auction site

## Description

Made a simple homepage, with the ability to post listings to the listing page. Picture is supposed to be side by side with the form but as im not great with scss i couldnt manage that.
Register and Loggin is working great with the API, and does its job. 
Listings is a little chaotic with the images posted in listings are alot if different sizes and hard to manage.

You can add some bullet points if you'd like to:

- Homepage
- Listings
- Login
- Register
